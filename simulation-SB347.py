# Description:
# This python script takes the output of the processing script 
# "setting_bars.pde" (rate of offspring production, Sequential 
# order of female, hermaphrodite and male production) and calculates
# for each time t the number of adult males, females and hermaphrodites

# Short description
# #################
#
# The behaviour of the simulation is controlled by a number of
# parameters and four input files.
# 
# A time unit corresponds to 8 hours, and is called a time-point.
# Each input file has a line for each time point in the adult lifespan of mothers.
# (Note that females and hermafrodites have the same adult lifespan.)
#
# Birth rate files
# ----------------
# 
# The total number of newborns generated by mothers of given sex and
# age is obtained from the two files
# 
# - <rate of female offspring production> and
# - <rate of hermaphrodite offspring production>.
# 
# These files contains one value between 0 and 1 per line.
# The i-th line corresponds to the birth rate of a mother whose age is i time-points.
# The values corresponds to the number of newborns the mother produces; 
# they are scaled so that 1 corresponds to 50 newborns per time unit.
#
# Birth proportion files
# ----------------------
#
# The proportion of newborns of each sex is controlled by the two files
#
# - <file of proportion of each gender by females>
# - <file of proportion of each gender by hermaphrodite>
#
# Each line in these files contains three comma-separated values between 0 and 1, which add up to 1.
#
# The values correspond to the proportion of the progeny which is of each sex. 
# 
# The columns refer to males, females and hermafrodites, in that order.
# 
# To calculate (say) the male progeny of an individual of a given sex at a given time-point:
# multiply the corresponding rate file line and the first-column value of the proportion file.
